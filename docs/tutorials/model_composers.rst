Model composers
===============

*Model composers* create new models by arraging existing model components
provided by :doc:`model component developers <./model_component_developers>`.

This is done by creating a python file in that used *entity types*, *process taxa*
and *model components* (TODO reference) are arranged in inheriting classes.

The basic structure of this file can be examined in the *_template* (reference TODO).

In the following a step-by-step tutorial, based on the exemplary
:doc:`seven dwarfs model <../_api/pycopancore.models>`, is provided.

Import of model components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


All components that are used must be imported. The *base model component* (reference TODO)
is used in every model and its import therefore mandatory.

Besides that, additional components can be included. In case of the *seven dwarfs model* (TODO reference)
the *seven_dwarfs* as well as *snowwhite* components are used.
::


    # base import (always needed)
    from .. import base

    # additional components
    from ..model_components import seven_dwarfs as sd
    from ..model_components import snowwhite as sw





Arrangement of entity types and process taxa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this step *entity types* and *process taxa* are arranged. This is done by basic python
inheritance. Note that primary inheritors will overwrite attributes of secondary ones (TODO better formulation).

::

    # entity types:

    class World(sd.World,
                base.World):
        """World entity type."""

        pass


    class Cell(sd.Cell,
               base.Cell):
        """Cell entity type."""

        pass


    class Individual(sd.Individual,
                     base.Individual):
        """Individual entity type."""

        pass


    # process taxa:

    class Culture(sd.Culture,
                  base.Culture):
        """Culture process taxon."""

        pass


The model class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This arrangement puts all model classes together. (TODO)


    # Model class:

    class Model(sd.Model,
                base.Model):
        """Class representing the whole model."""

        name = "Seven dwarfs"
        description = "Tutorial model"
        entity_types = [World, Cell, Individual]
        """List of entity types used in the model"""
        process_taxa = [Culture]
        """List of process taxa used in the model"""
