Model component subpackages
===========================

This section describes the package implementing a single model component.
Each such package is a subpackage of ``pycopancore.model_components``.


Subpackage structure
--------------------

A component subpackage contains one interface module, one model module,
and one implementation class module for each entity-type and process taxon that the component contributes to:

::

   <component name>
      implementation
        cell.py
        society.py
        individual.py
        nature.py
        social_metabolism.py
        culture.py
      interface.py
      model.py


Interface module
----------------

The interface module defines the attributes of all entity-types and process taxons contributed by this component.
Each attribute is an instance of ``Variable``,
either one imported from the master data model or another component, or a new instance.

Basic structure of ``interface.py``, using attributes imported from the data model and self-defined variables:

::

   from pycopancore import master_data_model as M
   from pycopancore import Variable, ReferenceVariable


   class Model (object):
      name = '<model name>'
      description = '<model description>'
      requires = []
      ...

   class Cell (object):
      <variable name> = M.Cell.<some variable name>
      <other variable name> = M.<some process taxon>.<some other variable name>
      ...

   class Society (object):
      ...

   class Nature (object):
      ...


Using a variable from the master data model under a locally different *alias*
can be useful e.g. if the model component makes simplifying assumptions regarding the equality of certain quantities,
but it should only be used in rare well-motivated occasions,
and *not* merely to introduce convenient abbreviations for having to type less letters.
In turn, the modeling board must ensure
that variable names in the master data model are reasonably short without losing distinguishability and descriptiveness.

If some needed attribute is not (yet) defined in the master data model
but is already defined in another component that this component necessarily *requires*
(i.e., if the component may not be meaningfully used in any model without the other component),
then the preferred choice is to import the attribute from the other component's *interface* (not implementation!) module as follows:

::

   from pycopancore import master_data_model as M

   import pycopancore.model_components.<other component name>.interface as O

   class Cell (object):
      <variable name> = O.Cell.<same variable name>
      <some alternative variable name> = O.Cell.<some original variable name>
      ...

   ...

However, if the import is not possible since the other component's interface itself already imports this component's interface
(either directly or indirectly via a sequence of imports), which would lead to an unallowed import cycle,
then the respective attribute shall not specified in this component's interface at all.
Instead, the implementation classes of this component shall reference the other component's attribute directly
via the *other* component's interface (see below).

Finally, if the needed attribute is not defined in either the master data model nor any components this component requires,
it must be defined (instead of imported) as an instance of the ``Variable`` class, specifying the variable's metadata.

We encourage using variable metadata from established catalogues of variables
such as the `CF Conventions Standard Names`_ for climate-related quantities
or the `World Bank's CETS list`_ of socio-economic indicators wherever possible,
ideally via the ``Variable`` class' subclasses ``CFVariable``, ``CETSVariable``, etc.,
but renaming the variable according to copan\:CORE's naming standards if necessary
(e.g. for a ``CETSVariable`` or for a ``CFVariable`` with too lengthy names).

:: _`CF Conventions Standard Names`: http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/37/build/cf-standard-name-table.html

:: _`World Bank's CETS list`: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/201175-how-does-the-world-bank-code-its-indicators

Example:

::

   from pycopancore import Entity, ProcessTaxon

   class Cell (object):
      <variable name> = Variable("<label>", <other metadata>...)
      surface_temperature = CFVariable() # ref. to CF Conventions Standard Names Entry of the same name
      atmospheric_carbon = CFVariable("atmosphere_mass_of_carbon_dioxide") # using an alias since Standard Name too long
      ...

   class Society (object):
      pct_population_65up = CETSVariable("SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS")
      ...

   ...

(Note that, actually, the variables ``surface_temperature`` and ``atmospheric_carbon``
used in this example are contained in the master data model
and should hence rather be imported from there in actual model components,
while ``pct_population_65up`` is not and should really be defined in the above way)

TODO: ReferenceVariable!

Example:

::

    from pycopancore import ReferenceVariable

    class Cell (object):
        <some entity> = ReferenceVariable('<some entity>', '<some description>',
                                type=<some entity>, allow_none=<some boolean value>)
        ...


Implementation class modules
----------------------------

For each entity-type and process taxon that the component contributes to,
an implementation class module defines the corresponding implementation class.

The latter is derived from the corresponding interface class that was defined in the interface module.

In its ``processes`` attribute, the implementation class specifies
the metadata of all processes the component contributes to this entity-type or process taxon,
by listing instances of suitable process type classes (``ODE``, ``Event``, ...).

It also defines these processes' logics by defining suitable instance methods
which are referenced in the above process metadata,
or by specifying symbolic expressions directly in the metadata.

Finally, an entity-type implementation class (but not a process taxon implementation class)
may override three special instance methods provided by the general base class ``Entity``
that are called upon initialization (e.g. birth or foundation),
"deactivation" (e.g. death, termination, collapse, loosing independence),
and possibly at "reactivation" (e.g., rebirth, regaining independence) of the entity,
usually at initialization and termination of the whole model,
and possibly also as a consequence of certain events belonging to the entity itself or to other entities (e.g. a parent). [#del]_

The basic structure of an implementation class module, here ``cell.py``
(similar for other entity-types and process taxons), is this:

::

   # import used process-types:
   from pycopancore import ODE, Explicit, Event, Step, ...

   # import the interface to be able to derive implementation class from interface class:
   import .interface

   # import base class for basic (de-)activation logics:
   from pycopancore import Entity

   class Cell (interface.Cell):

      # specify process metadata:

      processes = [
         ODE(..., rhs = <method name>),
         ODE(..., rhs = <some (list of) symbolic expression(s)>),
         Explicit(..., zero = <another method name>),
         Explicit(..., zero = <another (list of) symbolic expression(s)>),
         Event(..., rate = <rate symbolic expression>, action = <event method name>),
         Step(..., action = <step method name>),
         ...
      ]

      # define process logics:

      def <method name> (self, t):
         ...
         return <right-hand side>

      def <another method name> (self, t):
         ...
         return <what should be zero>

      def <event method name> (self, t):
         ...
         return

      def <step method name> (self, t):
         ...
         return next_t

      ...

      # optionally override initialization and (de-)activation methods:

      def __init__ (self, t):
         # always call general initialization method first:
         Entity.__init__(self, t)
         <do any necessary one-time initialization>
         return

      def deactivate (self, t):
         <do whatever may be necessary at deactivation>
         # always call general deactivation method last:
         Entity.deactivate(self, t)

      def reactivate (self, t):
         # always call general reactivation method first:
         Entity.reactivate(self, t)
         <do whatever may be necessary at reactivation>
         return


Implementation instance methods
-------------------------------

Bla...

In case of process taxons, please note that although those classes have only one instance,
the process logics is still implemented via instance methods (i.e., taking ``self`` as first argument)
rather than via class or static methods.
Likewise, the taxon's attribute values are stored in the sole instance's attributes,
while their metadata are stored in the respective class attributes, just as for entities and entity-types.

TODO...


.. [#del]   Note that upon deactivation, an entity object is *not* deleted but remains in memory
            not only since it may later be reactivated
            but mainly since it remains needed for several operations
            such as accessing its history during a model run's later analysis etc.
