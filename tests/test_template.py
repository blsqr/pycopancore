# first import pycopancore:
# import pycopancore as p

# since you want to test a specific module of a model, you might want to
# import it specifically, for example:
# import pycopancore.models.YOURMODEL as M

# Since it is nicer to test with random numbers, numpy.random is handy to use.
# import numpy as np

# Now, for every function in the module you want to test, write a test
# function named test_YOURFUNCTION:

# def test_YOURFUNCTION():
#   """Then you add a docstring.
#
#   If you have to explain more, feel free to write as much as you want to.
#   """
#   In the test, assert statements are the easiest way to test something:
#   assert np.random.rand() == 42
